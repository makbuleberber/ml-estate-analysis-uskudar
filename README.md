# Üsküdar House Age Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project focuses on classifying houses listed for sale in the Üsküdar district as **new (zero)** or **old (second-hand)** using supervised machine learning techniques.  
The study was conducted as part of a **Machine Learning course at Yıldız Technical University**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a residential property is new or old based on listing features.  
A complete machine learning pipeline was implemented, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.

Several classification algorithms were tested and compared. Among them, **Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (91.67%)**, making it the most successful model according to the selected evaluation metrics.
